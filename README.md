# Basic-Stock-Trading

This is a basic stock trading app where a user can perform the below functionalities

1. “Query” for specific stock tickers (i.e. search for $AAPL, $TSLA). Powered by [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library
2. “Buy” and “Sell” specific stock tickers
3. “View Portfolio” and see a list of all previously bought stock tickers.

I have used React.js to develop the frontend, and Flask web framework to develop the backend. I am using MySQL relational database to store all the data.
